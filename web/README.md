## Unix Philosophy Meets AI Engineering
Transform your AI workflows with production-ready building blocks that just work.

## AI Bits delivers modular, production-ready AI functions that follow Unix principles:
- Do one thing and do it well
- Work together seamlessly
- Handle text streams universally
- Scale from prototype to production

## Our core offerings:
1. **Inference Endpoints**: Deploy production-ready AI models with one command
2. **On-premises Containers**: Run AI workloads in your secure environment
3. **Open-Source Libraries**: Build with our battle-tested foundations

### Why Choose AI Bits

Because we believe AI infrastructure should be:
- **Reliable**: Built on proven Unix principles
- **Fast**: From prototype to production in minutes
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for what you use
- **Flexible**: Use anywhere, scale anytime
- **Open**: No vendor lock-in, full transparency

### How It Works

1. **Choose Your Building Blocks**
- Browse our library of AI functions
- Select pre-built containers or endpoints
- Mix and match to create your workflow

2. **Deploy Your Way**
```sh
# Same code can run from an inference endpoint or from on-prem deployment
lm summarize "this long article"
```

3. **Connect Everything**
```sh
# Build pipelines straight in the shell or in any language of your choice
lm summarize "this long article" > summary.txt
cat summary.txt | cv generate -p "use concepts from this article to generate an abstract picture" > image.jpg
if [[ \
  `cv classify "safe not-safe" -i image.jpg` == "safe" && \
  `cat summary.txt | lm classify "safe not-safe"` == "safe" \
]]; then return 0; fi
return 1
```

Built by developers, for developers.
Reliable. Fast. Open Source.


### Products
**Unix Pipelines Meet AI Functions**  
AiBits offers **three core products** to streamline your workflow:  
1. **Inference Endpoints**: Deploy low-latency AI models in seconds. Pay-per-request pricing.  
2. **On-Premises AI Containers**: Self-hosted, secure AI functions (NLP, vision, agents) with Kubernetes support.  
3. **Open-Source AI Libraries**: Modular, extensible code for building custom workflows. Think *“Legos for AI.”*  


### Benefits
- **Speed** Fast Inference Endpoints via our global API.
- **Security** On-premises or in your VPC.
- **Cost-effective, Scalable, Reliable** Modular, only pay money or compute for what you need. Smaller models and model routing out of the box
- **No vendor lock-in**

**The Value We Deliver**  
✅ **Cost:** 70% cheaper than major cloud providers.  
✅ **Speed:** Ship workflows 10x faster with Unix-style pipelining.  
✅ **Flexibility:** Mix-and-match open-source and proprietary modules.  

**Don’t Build It All From Scratch**
